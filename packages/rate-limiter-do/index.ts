// The RateLimiter Durable Object class.

// RateLimiter implements a Durable Object that tracks the frequency of messages from a particular
// source and decides when messages should be dropped because the source is sending too many
// messages.
//
// We utilize this in ChatRoom, above, to apply a per-IP-address rate limit. These limits are
// global, i.e. they apply across all chat rooms, so if a user spams one chat room, they will find
// themselves rate limited in all other chat rooms simultaneously.

		// Timestamp at which this IP will next be allowed to send a message. Start in the distant
		// past, i.e. the IP can send a message now.
		this.nextAllowedTime = 0;
	}

	// Our protocol is: POST when the IP performs an action, or GET to simply read the current limit.
	// Either way, the result is the number of seconds to wait before allowing the IP to perform its
	// next action.

			// We allow one action per 5 seconds.
			this.nextAllowedTime += 5;
		}

		// Return the number of seconds that the client needs to wait.
		//
		// We provide a "grace" period of 20 seconds, meaning that the client can make 4-5 requests
		// in a quick burst before they start being limited.
